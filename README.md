# MOBA-Team-Randomizer

Simple web app designed to randomly divide 10 players into 2 teams in MOBA games, where each player has to play on one of 5 available positions(Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom and Support). 

Functionalities:
* force and avoid position if we want to have more impact on how those positions would be assigned. 
* "Roll again" which ensures that(whenever it is possible) each player would be assigned with different position than in the last roll.
